## How to use

After installing from the Marketplace, run the command `Export Theme to Zed` from the command palette. You may be asked to install `theme_importer` if it's not already installed. This process may take a while.

Restart Zed (Preview) to see the theme.

If you're on an Intel Mac, you may need to supply the path to `theme_importer` in `settings.json`.

```json
{
  ...,
  "theme-to-zed.theme_importer": "/usr/local/bin/theme_importer"
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Note that, not all themes may work properly. The `theme_importer` is still under development. You may need to update periodically.

üåµ The installation of `theme_importer` will only happen once.

üèÑüèΩ Run `Update Zed theme_importer` periodically to update the binary of `theme_importer` to latest.
